mapred.map.tasks 2 The default number of map tasks per job. Typically
set to a prime several times greater than number of available hosts.
Ignored when mapred.job.tracker is "local".


mapred.reduce.tasks 1 The default number of reduce tasks per job.
Typically set to a prime close to the number of available hosts.
Ignored when mapred.job.tracker is "local".


We used two different cluster environments.
